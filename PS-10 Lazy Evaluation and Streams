;-----Interleaving streams ----;
;#|
;Write a procedure, (interleave s1 s2), that takes two streams and interleaves them. So, if
;   ones = (1 1 1 ...)
;   twos = (2 2 2 ...)
;   (interleave ones twos) = (1 2 1 2 1 2 ....)
;|#

(define (interleave lst1 lst2)
   (if (null? lst1) '()
       (cons-stream (stream-car lst1) (interleave lst2 (stream-cdr lst1)))))
       
       
;-----Mapping over a stream  ----;       
;#|
;Write a procedure, analogous to map, that takes a stream and a procedure and 
;returns the stream of values resulting from applying the procedure to each element 
;of the stream. You don't have to worry about dealing with the null stream. Assume 
;that cons-stream, stream-car and stream-cdr provide the data abstraction for a stream.
;We will also use the first few values of the stream as a way of testing equality in our test cases.       
;|#
 
;it is like eval-sequence         (EVAL-SEQUENCE IS SO USEFULL PROCEDURE) 
(define (map-stream proc stream)
  (cons-stream (proc (stream-car stream)) (map-stream proc (stream-cdr stream)))) 
  
 
;-----Filtering a stream ----;

;#|
;Write a procedure, analogous to filter, that takes a stream and a predicate and returns 
;the stream of values for which the predicate returns #t. You don't have to worry about 
;dealing with the null stream. Assume that cons-stream, stream-car and stream-cdr provide 
;the data abstraction for a stream.
;|#

(define (filter-stream proc stream)
  (if (proc (stream-car stream))
      (cons-stream (stream-car stream) (filter-stream proc (stream-cdr stream)))
      (filter-stream proc (stream-cdr stream))))
      
;-----Fibonacci numbers ----;

;#|
;Write a procedure, (fibs), that returns a stream of Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci series goes
;   (1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181 6765 ...)
;It starts with two 1's, then each successive value is the sum of the previous two. You may use
;the function (map2-stream p s1 s2), which maps a procedure of two arguments over two streams. 
;A particularly useful application of it is:
;    (map2-stream + ones twos) => (3 3 3 3 3 ....)
;
;Hint 0: Think about how many initial values you need to cons onto the front of the stream before 
;you can create a recursive data structure.

;-----Computing exponentials  ----;
#|
Write a procedure, (exponent x), that returns a stream of values that estimate the exponential 
function applied at x. To do this, use the power series idea from lecture. We have provided a 
procedure powers, of one argument, that returns a stream of the powers of its argument. We have also
provide a variable the-facts that is a stream of values for factorial, 1!, 2!, 3!, .... The power series for exponentiation is
1  + x  + x^2/2! + x^3/3! + ...
The output of your procedure should be a stream with elements
1
1  + x 
1  + x  + x^2/2! 
1  + x  + x^2/2! + x^3/3!
for any given value x
You may find map2-stream helpful in doing this.

(define map2-stream
  (lambda (p s1 s2)
    (cons-stream (p (stream-car s1) (stream-car s2))
		 (map2-stream p (stream-cdr s1) (stream-cdr s2)))))
 |#
 
 (define (exponent-terms x)
  (map2-stream / (stream-cdr (powers x)) the-facts))
  
(define exponent
       (lambda (x)
	 (cons-stream 1 (map2-stream + (exponent-terms x) (exponent x)))))
